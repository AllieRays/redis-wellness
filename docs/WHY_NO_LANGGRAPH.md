# Why We Don't Use LangGraph

**Architecture Decision**: Simple Tool-Calling Loops
**Date**: October 2024
**Status**: Active Decision

---

## TL;DR

We use **simple for-loops** for tool calling instead of LangGraph because:
- Redis already handles all persistence needs
- Our workflow is linear (not a complex graph)
- Simpler to debug and maintain
- Faster execution (no graph overhead)
- Zero serialization issues

---

## The Question

LangGraph is a popular framework for building agentic workflows with state management. Why didn't we use it?

---

## Our Architecture

### What We Built

```python
# Simple tool-calling loop (both agents use this pattern)
for iteration in range(max_iterations):
    # 1. Call LLM with tools
    response = await llm_with_tools.ainvoke(conversation)

    # 2. Check if LLM wants to call tools
    if not response.tool_calls:
        break  # Done!

    # 3. Execute each tool the LLM requested
    for tool_call in response.tool_calls:
        result = await tool.ainvoke(tool_call['args'])
        conversation.append(ToolMessage(content=result))

    # 4. Loop back to step 1 with tool results
```

**That's it.** No graphs, no nodes, no routing logic. Just a loop.

### Memory System

We use **Redis + RedisVL** for the CoALA memory framework:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CoALA 4-Memory System (Redis + RedisVL)       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. Short-term (Redis LIST)                     │
│     - Recent conversation history               │
│     - 7-month TTL                               │
│                                                 │
│  2. Episodic (RedisVL Vector Search)            │
│     - User preferences, goals, events           │
│     - Semantic search for personal context      │
│                                                 │
│  3. Procedural (Redis Hash)                     │
│     - Learned tool sequences                    │
│     - O(1) pattern lookup                       │
│                                                 │
│  4. Semantic (RedisVL Vector Search)            │
│     - General health knowledge                  │
│     - Semantic search for facts                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Why Not LangGraph?

### 1. **Workflow Complexity Mismatch**

**Our workflow is linear:**
```
User query → LLM → Tools → LLM → Response
```

**LangGraph is designed for complex graphs:**
```
Node A → Branch (Node B or Node C) → Loop back to Node A → Node D
      ↓                                              ↑
    Node E ←─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

We don't have multiple paths, branches, or complex routing. A simple loop handles our use case perfectly.

### 2. **Redis Already Handles State**

**What LangGraph provides:**
- State persistence via checkpointers
- Memory between conversation turns
- State snapshots for debugging

**What we already have:**
- Redis for conversation history (short-term memory)
- RedisVL for semantic/episodic memory (long-term memory)
- Redis Hash for procedural patterns
- 7-month TTL with automatic cleanup

**Verdict**: We'd be maintaining TWO state systems (Redis + LangGraph checkpointer) instead of one.

### 3. **Serialization Issues**

When we initially explored LangGraph, we encountered:

```python
# LangGraph's MemorySaver tried to serialize everything
state = {
    "messages": [...],  # ✅ Works
    "tools": [StructuredTool(...)],  # ❌ Can't serialize
    "llm": ChatOllama(...),  # ❌ Can't serialize
}
```

**The workaround?** Disable checkpointing entirely.

**The result?** We'd be using LangGraph WITHOUT its main benefit (state management).

### 4. **Debugging Simplicity**

**Simple loop debugging:**
```bash
# Set breakpoint at line 145
# Step through each iteration
# Inspect conversation array
# See exactly what LLM returned
```

**LangGraph debugging:**
```bash
# Which node am I in?
# What triggered this edge?
# Check state at each node
# Trace graph execution path
```

For a linear workflow, the simple loop is **dramatically easier** to debug.

### 5. **Performance**

**Simple loop:**
- Direct function calls
- No graph compilation
- No state serialization
- No routing overhead

**LangGraph:**
- Graph compilation step
- Node execution overhead
- State management overhead
- Conditional edge evaluation

**Benchmarks** (typical query):
- Simple loop: ~3-8 seconds
- LangGraph (estimated): ~4-10 seconds

The overhead is small but unnecessary for our use case.

### 6. **Code Complexity**

**Simple loop agent** (`stateless_agent.py`):
- 182 lines total
- Tool loop: ~30 lines
- Easy to understand in 5 minutes

**LangGraph agent** (previous version):
- 361 lines total
- StateGraph setup: ~70 lines
- Node definitions: ~50 lines
- Routing logic: ~40 lines
- Harder to onboard new developers

**Maintenance cost**: ~2x for the same behavior.

## What We Considered

### Pros of LangGraph (that we evaluated)

✅ **Built-in state management**
→ But Redis already provides this

✅ **Conditional branching**
→ But our workflow is linear

✅ **Checkpointing and replay**
→ But we don't need replay (health data doesn't change)

✅ **Visual graph debugging**
→ Nice, but not worth the complexity for a simple loop

✅ **Standardized framework**
→ True, but our simple pattern is also easy to understand

### Cons of LangGraph

❌ Adds complexity without benefit for linear workflows
❌ Requires learning graph concepts
❌ Harder to debug for simple cases
❌ Serialization issues with custom tools
❌ Redundant with Redis state management
❌ Performance overhead

---

## When Would We Use LangGraph?

LangGraph would make sense if we had:

### 1. **Complex Branching Logic**
```
If user asks about nutrition → Nutrition Node → Meal Planning Node
If user asks about fitness   → Workout Node → Progress Tracking Node
If user asks about both       → Coordinator Node → Both paths
```

**Our case**: All queries go through the same path (tools → LLM → done)

### 2. **Human-in-the-Loop Workflows**
```
Agent → Generate Plan → [WAIT FOR HUMAN APPROVAL] → Execute Plan
```

**Our case**: Fully autonomous, no approval steps

### 3. **Multi-Agent Coordination**
```
Research Agent → Planning Agent → Execution Agent → Review Agent
```

**Our case**: Single agent with tool access

### 4. **Long-Running Processes**
```
Day 1: Collect data → [PAUSE STATE] → Day 2: Resume and analyze
```

**Our case**: Queries complete in seconds, no pause/resume

### 5. **Replay and Time-Travel Debugging**
```
Query failed → Replay from checkpoint 3 → Modify state → Continue
```

**Our case**: Health data is read-only, no need to replay

## Architecture Comparison

### Simple Loop (Current)

```python
class StatefulRAGAgent:
    async def chat(self, message, session_id):
        # 1. Retrieve memory from Redis
        memory = await self.memory_coordinator.retrieve_context(
            session_id, message
        )

        # 2. Build conversation with memory
        conversation = [
            SystemMessage(content=self._build_prompt(memory)),
            HumanMessage(content=message)
        ]

        # 3. Simple tool loop
        for _ in range(MAX_ITERATIONS):
            response = await self.llm.ainvoke(conversation)
            conversation.append(response)

            if not response.tool_calls:
                break

            for tool_call in response.tool_calls:
                result = await self._execute_tool(tool_call)
                conversation.append(ToolMessage(content=result))

        # 4. Store in Redis memory
        await self.memory_coordinator.store_interaction(
            session_id, message, response.content
        )

        return response.content
```

**Lines of code**: ~60
**Complexity**: Low
**Dependencies**: LangChain, Redis
**Performance**: Fast

### LangGraph (Alternative We Rejected)

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

class StatefulRAGAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # Build graph
        workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)

        # Add nodes
        workflow.add_node("agent", self.call_llm)
        workflow.add_node("tools", ToolNode(self.tools))
        workflow.add_node("memory", self.retrieve_memory)

        # Add edges
        workflow.add_edge("memory", "agent")
        workflow.add_conditional_edges(
            "agent",
            self.should_continue,
            {
                "continue": "tools",
                "end": END
            }
        )
        workflow.add_edge("tools", "agent")

        # Set entry point
        workflow.set_entry_point("memory")

        # Compile with checkpointer
        self.app = workflow.compile(
            checkpointer=MemorySaver()  # Conflicts with Redis!
        )

    async def call_llm(self, state):
        response = await self.llm.ainvoke(state["messages"])
        return {"messages": state["messages"] + [response]}

    def should_continue(self, state):
        last_message = state["messages"][-1]
        if last_message.tool_calls:
            return "continue"
        return "end"

    async def retrieve_memory(self, state):
        memory = await self.memory_coordinator.retrieve_context(...)
        return {"memory_context": memory}
```

**Lines of code**: ~150
**Complexity**: Medium-High
**Dependencies**: LangChain, LangGraph, Redis
**Performance**: Slower
**Issue**: MemorySaver conflicts with Redis state

## FAQ

### Q: "But LangGraph is the industry standard!"

**A**: LangGraph is excellent **for complex graphs**. Our workflow is a simple loop. Using LangGraph here is like using a Ferrari for a grocery run—overkill.

### Q: "What if we need to add complexity later?"

**A**: Then we'll migrate to LangGraph! The beauty of our architecture:
- Tool definitions are framework-agnostic
- Redis memory system works with any agent
- Migration would take ~2 days, not 2 months

### Q: "Isn't this just 'not invented here' syndrome?"

**A**: No. We use:
- LangChain (tool interface, LLM wrappers)
- Redis + RedisVL (state management)
- Qwen 2.5 (tool calling LLM)
- FastAPI, Pydantic, etc.

We're pragmatic about frameworks. LangGraph solves problems **we don't have**.

### Q: "How do you handle state between turns?"

**A**: Redis + RedisVL provides:
- Conversation history (short-term memory)
- Semantic search (episodic + semantic memory)
- Tool pattern learning (procedural memory)

This is MORE sophisticated than LangGraph's checkpointer, not less.

### Q: "Can you show me the decision was intentional?"

**A**: See `docs/archive/LANGGRAPH_REMOVAL_PLAN.md` — we explicitly evaluated and rejected it.

## The Bottom Line

> **"Use the simplest thing that works."**

For linear tool-calling workflows with external state management (Redis), a simple loop is:
- ✅ Easier to understand
- ✅ Easier to debug
- ✅ Faster to execute
- ✅ Simpler to maintain
- ✅ Just as powerful

We don't use LangGraph because **we don't need it**.

If our requirements change (complex branching, multi-agent coordination, human-in-the-loop), we'll revisit this decision. Until then, simplicity wins.

1. **Simplicity First** - Use the simplest solution that meets requirements
2. **Avoid Over-Engineering** - Don't add frameworks "just in case"
3. **Optimize for Maintenance** - Future developers will thank us
4. **Pragmatic Tool Selection** - Use what solves actual problems
5. **Performance Matters** - Every millisecond counts in UX
