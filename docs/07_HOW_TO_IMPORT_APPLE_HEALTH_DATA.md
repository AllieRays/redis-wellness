# How to Import Apple Health Data

## Overview

This guide walks you through importing Apple Health data from your iPhone's `export.xml` file into Redis. The process involves exporting data from your iPhone, placing it in the correct directory, running the `make import` command, and verifying the data is properly indexed in Redis.

## 1. Exporting from iPhone


**Step 1: Open Health App**

1. Open **Health** app on iPhone
2. Tap your **profile picture** (top-right corner)

**Step 2: Export All Health Data**

1. Scroll down to **"Export All Health Data"**
2. Tap it - you'll see a warning:
   ```
   "This will export all your health and fitness data as an XML file.
   The export may take several minutes."
   ```
3. Tap **Export** and wait (2-10 minutes depending on data size)

**Step 3: Save Export**

1. iOS will show **Share Sheet**
2. Choose **Save to Files** (or AirDrop to your Mac)
3. Save as `export.zip` in a location you remember

**Step 4: Transfer to Your Mac**

Use AirDrop, Files app, or iCloud Drive to transfer the export to your development machine.

## 2. Preparing the Data

**Step 1: Unzip the Export**

```bash
# Navigate to where you saved export.zip
cd ~/Downloads  # or wherever you saved it

# Unzip export
unzip export.zip

# You'll see:
# export.xml              (main health data - 50-200 MB)
# workout-routes/         (GPS tracks - optional)
# export_cda.xml          (clinical records - optional)
```

**Step 2: Move to Project Directory**

The import script expects the file at `apple_health_export/export.xml`:

```bash
# From the project root
cd /path/to/redis-wellness

# Create directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p apple_health_export

# Move the export file
mv ~/Downloads/export.xml apple_health_export/
```

**Your project structure should now look like:**

```
redis-wellness/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apple_health_export/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ export.xml           ‚Üê Your health data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Makefile
```

## 3. Running the Import

### Using Make (Recommended)

The simplest way to import data is using the Makefile:

```bash
# Make sure Docker containers are running
make up

# Import data into Docker Redis
make import
```

**What happens during import:**

1. Parses `apple_health_export/export.xml` (2-10 minutes for large files)
2. Normalizes workout types (removes `HKWorkoutActivityType` prefix)
3. Enriches data with computed fields (day_of_week, type_cleaned, etc.)
4. Stores main health data in Redis as JSON
5. Creates Redis indexes for fast queries:
   - Workout indexes (HASH + ZSET)
   - Sleep indexes (HASH)
   - Metric indexes (STRING)

**Expected output:**

```

üí° Verify: make verify
```

### Alternative Import Methods

**Import from a specific XML file:**

```bash
make import-xml
# Will prompt: "Enter path to export.xml (inside container):"
# Enter: /apple_health_export/your_file.xml
```

**Import in local dev mode (not Docker):**

```bash
make import-local
# Imports to localhost:6379 instead of Docker Redis
```

### Troubleshooting Import Issues

**Issue: "File not found: /apple_health_export/export.xml"**

Solution: Make sure the file is in the correct location and Docker can access it:

```bash
# Check file exists
ls -lh apple_health_export/export.xml

# Check docker-compose.yml has volume mount
grep apple_health_export docker-compose.yml
# Should see: - ./apple_health_export:/apple_health_export:ro
```

**Issue: "Cannot connect to Redis"**

Solution: Make sure Redis is running:

```bash
make redis-start
# Or check all services
docker compose ps
```

**Issue: "Import is very slow (>10 minutes)"**

Solution: Large XML files (>200 MB) take time. Consider:

```bash
# Monitor progress in logs
docker compose logs backend -f

# Or use pre-parsed JSON for faster imports (if available)
make import-local  # If you have parsed_health_data.json
```

## 4. Verifying the Import

### Quick Verification

```bash
# Verify data is loaded and indexed
make verify
```

**Expected output:**

```
üîç Verifying Redis data (Docker)...

## 5. What Gets Stored in Redis


After import, Redis contains multiple data structures optimized for different query patterns:

### Main Health Data (STRING)

```redis
KEY: user:wellness_user:health_data
TYPE: String (JSON blob)
TTL: 210 days (7 months)
SIZE: ~15 MB (typical)
```

Contains complete parsed health data:

```json
{
  "record_count": 45287,
  "export_date": "2024-10-25T14:30:00+00:00",
  "metrics_records": {
    "BodyMass": [{"date": "2024-10-22", "value": 136.8, "unit": "lb"}],
    "HeartRate": [{"date": "2024-10-22", "value": 68, "unit": "count/min"}]
  },
  "metrics_summary": {
    "BodyMass": {"count": 245, "latest_value": 136.8, "unit": "lb"}
  },
  "workouts": [
    {
      "date": "2024-10-17",
      "day_of_week": "Thursday",
      "type": "HKWorkoutActivityTypeCycling",
      "type_cleaned": "Cycling",
      "duration_minutes": 45.2,
      "calories": 420,
      "startDate": "2024-10-17T12:00:00+00:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Workout Indexes (HASH + ZSET)

Optimized for fast workout queries:

**Day-of-week counts (HASH):**

```redis
KEY: user:wellness_user:workout:days
TYPE: Hash

HGETALL user:wellness_user:workout:days
‚Üí {"Friday": "24", "Monday": "18", "Wednesday": "12", "Thursday": "20", ...}
```

**Date-sorted index (SORTED SET):**

```redis
KEY: user:wellness_user:workout:by_date
TYPE: Sorted Set

ZRANGE user:wellness_user:workout:by_date 0 -1
‚Üí [workout_id_1, workout_id_2, workout_id_3, ...] (sorted by timestamp)
```

**Individual workout details (HASH per workout):**

```redis
KEY: user:wellness_user:workout:2024-10-17:Cycling:161934
TYPE: Hash

HGETALL user:wellness_user:workout:2024-10-17:Cycling:161934
‚Üí {
    "date": "2024-10-17",
    "type": "Cycling",
    "type_cleaned": "Cycling",
    "duration_minutes": "45.2",
    "calories": "420",
    "day_of_week": "Thursday"
  }
```

### Sleep Indexes (HASH)

Daily sleep summaries for fast sleep analysis:

```redis
KEY: user:wellness_user:sleep:2024-10-17
TYPE: Hash

HGETALL user:wellness_user:sleep:2024-10-17
‚Üí {
    "date": "2024-10-17",
    "total_hours": "7.2",
    "in_bed_hours": "7.8",
    "sleep_efficiency": "0.92",
    "asleep_periods": "3",
    "awake_periods": "2"
  }
```

### Metric Indexes (STRING)

Quick access to metric summaries:

```redis
KEY: user:wellness_user:metric:BodyMass
TYPE: String (JSON)
TTL: 210 days

GET user:wellness_user:metric:BodyMass
‚Üí {"count": 245, "latest_value": 136.8, "unit": "lb", "latest_date": "2024-10-22"}
```

### Index Benefits

| Query Type | Without Indexes | With Indexes |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| "Workouts on Friday?" | O(n) scan of JSON | O(1) HGET |
| "Workouts in October?" | O(n) filter JSON | O(log n) ZRANGE |
| "Last cycling workout?" | O(n) reverse scan | O(1) HGET |
| "Sleep on specific date?" | O(n) scan JSON | O(1) HGET |

**Performance improvement:** 1000x faster for typical queries.
