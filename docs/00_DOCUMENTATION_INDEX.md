## Archive

**Key archived files**:
- `DEMO_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Comprehensive demo documentation
- `AGENT_COMPARISON.md` - Detailed agent comparison

## Documentation Principles

### 1. Numbered for Order
Files are prefixed with numbers (01, 02, 03...) to establish a clear reading order.

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
- Start simple (Quick Start)
- Add detail progressively (Architecture, Development)
- Reference deep-dives for advanced topics

### 3. Action-Oriented
Each doc focuses on **what to do** rather than historical context or internal discussions.

### 4. Cross-Referenced
Documents link to related docs for deeper information.

### 5. Professional Tone
Written for senior engineers and technical interviewers.
