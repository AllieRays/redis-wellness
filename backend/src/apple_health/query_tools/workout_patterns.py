Workout Pattern Analysis Tools - Dynamic analysis of workout schedules and intensity.

These tools analyze workout data from Redis to answer pattern questions like:
- "What days do I work out?"
- "What day do I work out harder?"
- "How consistent am I?"

The tools perform data analysis so Qwen doesn't have to count or calculate patterns.
