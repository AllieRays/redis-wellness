- All numbered docs (Related Documentation sections)
- `WARP.md` (if referencing docs)

### Step 5: Verify Template Compliance ‚úÖ
Check each doc has:
- `## 1. Overview` with "What You'll Learn" bullets
- Numbered sections (2, 3, 4...)
- Code examples with proper formatting
- `## N. Related Documentation` section
- `**Key takeaway:**` at end

## 10_EXAMPLE_QUERIES.md Structure

### Proposed Format:

```markdown
# Example Queries: Stateless vs Stateful Comparison

## 1. Basic Health Queries

### Query: "What was my average heart rate last week?"

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Feature** | Health metric retrieval with statistics |
| **Tool Used** | `get_health_metrics` |
| **Memory Type** | None (stateless) / Short-term (stateful) |
| **Stateless Response** | "Your average heart rate last week was 72 bpm." |
| **Stateful Response** | "Your average heart rate last week was 72 bpm. This is consistent with your baseline from the previous week." |
| **Key Difference** | Stateful can reference previous context |

---

## 2. Follow-up Questions

### Initial Query: "How many workouts do I have?"

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Tool Used** | `get_workout_data` |
| **Stateless Response** | "You have 154 workouts recorded." |
| **Stateful Response** | "You have 154 workouts recorded." |

### Follow-up: "What's the most common type?"

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Memory Type** | None / Short-term checkpointing |
| **Stateless Response** | ‚ùå "What are you referring to? Please provide more context." |
| **Stateful Response** | ‚úÖ "Traditional Strength Training is your most common workout type (40 workouts, 26% of total)." |
| **Key Difference** | Stateful remembers "workouts" from previous turn |

---

## 3. Pronoun Resolution

### Initial: "When was my last cycling workout?"
### Follow-up: "How long was it?"

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Memory Type** | Short-term checkpointing |
| **Stateless Response** | ‚ùå "How long was what? Please specify." |
| **Stateful Response** | ‚úÖ "Your last cycling workout on October 17th was 45 minutes long." |
| **Pronoun Resolved** | "it" ‚Üí "last cycling workout on October 17th" |

---

## 4. Goal-Based Queries (Episodic Memory)

### Query: "Am I on track for my weight goal?"

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Tool Used (Stateless)** | `get_health_metrics` only |
| **Tool Used (Stateful)** | `get_my_goals` (retrieves from RedisVL) ‚Üí `get_health_metrics` |
| **Memory Type** | None / Episodic (RedisVL vector search) |
| **Stateless Response** | ‚ùå "I don't have information about your goals. What is your target weight?" |
| **Stateful Response** | ‚úÖ "Your goal is 125 lbs by December. Current weight: 136.8 lbs. You've lost 8.2 lbs since September - great progress!" |
| **Redis Key** | `episodic:wellness_user:goal:1729962000` |
| **How Retrieved** | LLM calls `get_my_goals` tool autonomously |

---

## 5. Pattern Learning (Procedural Memory)

### Query: "Compare my activity this month vs last month"

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Tool Used (First Time)** | `get_workout_data` + `get_health_metrics` |
| **Tool Used (After Learning)** | `get_tool_suggestions` (retrieves pattern) ‚Üí same tools but faster |
| **Memory Type** | None / Procedural (learned workflow) |
| **Stateless Performance** | 2.8s (figures out tools each time) |
| **Stateful Performance (1st)** | 2.8s (same as stateless) |
| **Stateful Performance (2nd+)** | 1.9s (retrieves successful pattern) |
| **Redis Key** | `procedural:pattern:1729962000` |
| **How Retrieved** | LLM calls `get_tool_suggestions` tool if query is similar |

---

## 6. Multi-Turn Reasoning

### Conversation Flow

**Turn 1**: "What was my heart rate during workouts last week?"
**Turn 2**: "How does that compare to this week?"
**Turn 3**: "Is the trend concerning?"

| Agent | Turn 3 Response |
|-------|----------------|
| **Stateless** | ‚ùå "I need context. What trend are you referring to?" |
| **Stateful** | ‚úÖ "Your average workout heart rate increased from 142 bpm last week to 156 bpm this week. This 10% increase isn't concerning if you intensified your workouts, which your data shows (cycling replaced walking). If intensity didn't change, consider recovery." |

**Memory Used**:
- Short-term: All 3 conversation turns
- Episodic: User's heart rate goals (if set)
- Procedural: Similar comparison queries

---

## 7. Tool Chaining Examples

### Query: "Show me my workout pattern and tell me if I'm improving"

**Stateless Agent**:
1. ‚ùå Calls `get_workout_data` ‚Üí lists workouts
2. ‚ùå Stops (no memory to chain to next tool)
3. Response: "Here are your workouts: [list]. What would you like to know?"

**Stateful Agent**:
1. ‚úÖ Calls `get_workout_data` (pattern analysis)
2. ‚úÖ Sees pattern result, autonomously calls `get_workout_progress` (improvement tracking)
3. ‚úÖ Calls `get_my_goals` (checks if improvement aligns with goals)
4. Response: "You work out most on Fridays (24 workouts). Your frequency increased 50% this month vs last month, which aligns with your goal of 3x/week."

**Key Difference**: Stateful agent chains tools autonomously based on context.
```
